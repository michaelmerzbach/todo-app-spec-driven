# Feature Specification: User Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-authentication`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a user authentication system with: Email and password registration, Secure login with JWT tokens, Password hashing with bcrypt, Protected routes, User session management"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - New User Registration (Priority: P1)

A new visitor creates an account to access protected features of the application. They provide their email address and create a password to establish their identity.

**Why this priority**: Registration is the foundation of authentication - without it, no users can access the system. This is the entry point for all user interactions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting registration form with valid email and password, then verifying account creation without requiring login functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a new visitor, **When** I submit valid email and password, **Then** my account is created and I receive confirmation
2. **Given** I am registering with an existing email, **When** I submit the form, **Then** I receive an error indicating the email is already registered
3. **Given** I submit a weak password, **When** I attempt registration, **Then** I receive clear requirements for password strength
4. **Given** I submit an invalid email format, **When** I attempt registration, **Then** I receive validation feedback before submission

### User Story 2 - User Login (Priority: P1)

An existing user accesses their account by providing their registered email and password credentials. Upon successful authentication, they gain access to protected features.

**Why this priority**: Login enables users to access their accounts - equally critical as registration for system functionality. Without login, registration serves no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting login with registered credentials and verifying access token is provided and user gains access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a registered account, **When** I enter correct email and password, **Then** I am authenticated and redirected to the application
2. **Given** I enter incorrect password, **When** I submit login form, **Then** I receive an error message without revealing which credential was incorrect
3. **Given** I enter an unregistered email, **When** I submit login form, **Then** I receive a generic authentication error
4. **Given** I have multiple failed login attempts, **When** I exceed the attempt threshold, **Then** I am temporarily blocked from attempting further logins with increasing cooldown periods

---

### User Story 3 - Access Protected Resources (Priority: P1)

An authenticated user accesses protected areas of the application. Their session is maintained securely, allowing continued access without repeated authentication while ensuring unauthorized users are blocked.

**Why this priority**: Protected routes are the core security feature - they ensure only authenticated users access sensitive functionality. This is the primary value of authentication.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to access protected routes with valid/invalid tokens and verifying proper access control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I navigate to protected pages, **Then** I can access them without re-authenticating
2. **Given** I am not logged in, **When** I attempt to access protected pages, **Then** I am redirected to login
3. **Given** my session expires, **When** I attempt to access protected pages, **Then** I am prompted to re-authenticate
4. **Given** I close my browser and return, **When** I access the application, **Then** I am required to log in again (session does not persist across browser closures)

---

### User Story 4 - Session Management (Priority: P2)

A logged-in user maintains their authenticated state across page refreshes and navigation. They can explicitly log out when finished, and their session automatically expires after a period of inactivity for security.

**Why this priority**: Essential for usability and security, but system can function without explicit logout or timeout features in initial release.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by monitoring session state across navigation, verifying logout clears credentials, and testing session expiration timers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I refresh the page, **Then** I remain authenticated
2. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I explicitly log out, **Then** my session is terminated and I cannot access protected resources
3. **Given** I am inactive for the timeout period, **When** I attempt an action, **Then** my session is expired and I must re-authenticate
4. **Given** I log out, **When** I use the browser back button, **Then** I cannot access previously viewed protected pages

---

### User Story 5 - Password Reset (Priority: P3)

A user who forgot their password can securely reset it through a verified process without contacting support. This maintains account security while providing self-service recovery.

**Why this priority**: Important for user experience but not essential for initial system operation. Users can still use the system with remembered passwords.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by initiating password reset flow, verifying email delivery, and confirming password change without requiring other authentication features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I forgot my password, **When** I request a password reset, **Then** I receive a secure reset link via email
2. **Given** I receive a reset link, **When** I click it within the valid timeframe, **Then** I can set a new password
3. **Given** the reset link has expired, **When** I attempt to use it, **Then** I receive an error and option to request a new link
4. **Given** I successfully reset my password, **When** I login with the new password, **Then** I am authenticated and old password no longer works

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user attempts to register with an email that has uppercase letters (email case sensitivity)?
- How does the system handle concurrent login sessions from different devices or browsers?
- What happens when a user's session token is tampered with or corrupted?
- How does the system handle password reset requests for non-existent email addresses (avoid user enumeration)?
- What happens when a user changes their password while having active sessions on multiple devices?
- How does the system handle special characters or Unicode in passwords?
- What happens when session storage is full or unavailable?
- How does the system prevent timing attacks during authentication validation?

- **SC-005**: System successfully maintains user sessions across page navigation with 0% unintended logouts
- **SC-006**: Password reset requests are fulfilled within 5 minutes (email delivery time) for 95% of cases
- **SC-007**: System handles 1000 concurrent authentication requests without performance degradation
- **SC-008**: Zero plaintext passwords are stored in the system (100% hashed with secure algorithm)
- **SC-009**: Failed authentication attempts are logged with 100% accuracy for security auditing

## Assumptions

- Email delivery service is available and reliable for sending password reset links
- Users have access to their email accounts to verify registration and reset passwords
- Application uses standard web technologies (HTTP/HTTPS) for request/response
- Authentication tokens are transmitted securely (HTTPS) to prevent interception
- Users access the application through standard web browsers or mobile apps
- System has secure storage mechanism for sensitive data (hashed passwords, tokens)
- Default session timeout of 24 hours is acceptable unless business requirements specify otherwise
- Default password complexity (8 characters, letters and numbers) meets security requirements
- Rate limiting is acceptable for authentication endpoints (prevents legitimate users during attacks)
- Token refresh mechanism will be implemented to maintain long-lived sessions without compromising security

## Out of Scope

- Social login integration (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Email verification during registration (confirm email ownership)
- Account deletion or deactivation features
- User profile management beyond authentication credentials
- Role-based access control (RBAC) or permissions system
- Account recovery through security questions
- Password strength meter or complexity visualization
- Login history or device management for users
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration with external identity providers
